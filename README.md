# HTML-CSS-CapstoneProject

The online store was made as a final Microver HTML-CSS project. It has two pages in which the design given by the author Mohammed Awad was followed and customized for a printer sales store, testing the best front-end practices.
I used bootstrap as the main framework, the site also was built with media queries and it is completely responsive in two screen sizes.
